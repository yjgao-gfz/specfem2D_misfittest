    "`Pyadjoint` is a Python package to measure misfits and calculate adjoint sources. It aims to provide a comprehensive package and incorporate various types of measurements and associated adjoint sources.\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pyadjoint` utilizes [ObsPy](http://obspy.org) (and some of its dependencies) for the processing and data handling. As a first step, please follow the [installation instructions of ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki#installation) for your given platform (we recommend the installation with [Anaconda](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Installation-via-Anaconda) as it will most likely result in the least amount of problems). `Pyadjoint` should work with Python versions 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5. To install it, best use `pip` (not working yet!):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install pyadjoint\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the latest development version, or want to work on the code, you will have to install with the help of `git`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/krischer/pyadjoint.git\n",
    "$ cd pyadjoint\n",
    "$ pip install -v -e .\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Tests\n",

    "To assure the installation is valid and everything works as expected, run the tests with\n",
